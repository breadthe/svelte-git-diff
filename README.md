# GitHub Diff

A simple tool that pretty much does what GitHub's own diffing tool does (Example: [https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/8.x...master](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/8.x...master)), but in a more simple manner.

This project is built with Svelte + TailwindCSS, and generated from [Svelte + TailwindCSS 2.0 starter](https://github.com/breadthe/svelte-tailwind2-starter).
